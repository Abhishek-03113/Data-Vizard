Data Visualization Tool
This project is a data visualization tool built using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. It allows users to upload a CSV file, select features for comparison, and choose the type of chart to generate and display based on the selected features.

Features
The tool supports the following types of charts:

Line Chart
Bar Chart
Scatter Plot
Bubble Plot
Pie Chart
Histogram
Heatmap
Polar Chart
Usage
To use the tool, run the main Python script. The main() function is the entry point of the tool.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
In the main() function, you can upload a CSV file, select features for comparison, and choose the type of chart to generate.

def main():
    st.title("Data Visualization Tool")
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"])
    ...
Functions
The tool includes several functions to generate different types of charts. Each function takes a pandas DataFrame and a list of selected features as input, and generates a chart based on the selected features.

For example, the generate_line_chart(df, selected_features) function generates a line chart by plotting the values of the selected features against the index of the DataFrame.

def generate_line_chart(df, selected_features):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for feature in selected_features:
        plt.plot(df.index, df[feature], label=feature)
    ...
